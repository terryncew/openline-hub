# Time lags and Power (τ as a vector)

In human systems, “feedback” is not one thing. It has stages. You can see harm quickly and still never repair it.

## τ as a vector (the stages of lag)
- τ_obs: time to notice what happened (visibility)
- τ_interpret: time to agree on what it means (causal story, evidence, standards)
- τ_dec: time to decide what to do
- τ_act: time to do it
- τ_settle: time until the world actually updates and the harm is repaired (or prevented next time)

Most institutions optimize τ_obs (dashboards, transparency) because it’s easy to measure.
Most harm persists because τ_settle stays huge.

## The “theatre” falsifier (can’t-lie test)
When clear harm appears, does the system:
A) debate the metric/story endlessly, or
B) change the world (settlement)?

If the default is A, you’re in τ_settle hell. Visibility became theater.

## A simple action rule (keeps this from becoming a math zoo)
In justice/harm domains, treat:
τ := τ_settle (unless proven otherwise)

Meaning: if nothing gets repaired, nothing counts as “fast feedback.”

## Power, in plain English
Power is the ability to keep your own lag short and your own evidence clear while making other people wait and argue in fog.

Operational definition:
Power ≈ control of τ + control of q

Where q = signal quality (how clear, trustworthy, and usable the evidence is).

A strong asymmetry looks like:
- one side gets quick decisions, quick action, and clear proof
- the other side gets delays, disputes over evidence, and endless interpretation fights

## Why τ_interpret matters in 2025
Modern systems can have:
- fast observation (τ_obs low)
- infinite argument (τ_interpret high)
- zero repair (τ_settle → huge)

That’s “high information, low update.” It feels like progress while nothing changes.

## The trust-preserving connection to AISP
AISP keeps curiosity fast (low τ for learning) while tightening settlement for actions:
- talk stays quick
- actions get preview/sandbox/consent so settlement is deliberate
- operators get clear, minimal logs (high q) without turning the system into surveillance

One sentence summary:
Fast visibility is not justice; settlement is justice. Power often lives in the gap.
